# 🤖 AI-Powered Dynamic Website Personalization

> Real-time website optimization using AI and user behavior analysis

## 🎯 Concept

This system demonstrates how AI can analyze user behavior through cookies and dynamically personalize website experiences in real-time. Instead of showing the same page to everyone, the website adapts based on user patterns - pricing-focused users see pricing prominently, content explorers get detailed information, and quick browsers get simplified experiences.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Command Setup
```bash
./setup.sh && ./start-demo.sh
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

## 🎬 Demo Instructions

1. **Start with baseline**: See the default website experience
2. **Simulate user personas**:
   - 📊 **Sarah**: Pricing-focused returning visitor
   - 📚 **Marcus**: Content explorer who reads everything  
   - ⚡ **Alex**: Quick browser who wants simplicity
3. **Watch AI optimization**: Page transforms in real-time based on behavior
4. **View analytics**: Toggle real-time metrics and optimization success
