# PostHog Analytics Setup Guide

## Current Status
‚úÖ PostHog has been integrated into your Y Combinator website clone
‚ö†Ô∏è **API Key Issue**: The provided key appears to be a personal API key, but PostHog requires a **project API key**

## How to Get the Correct API Key

1. **Log into PostHog**: Go to [app.posthog.com](https://app.posthog.com)
2. **Navigate to Project Settings**: Click on your project ‚Üí Settings
3. **Find Project API Key**: Look for "Project API Key" (starts with `phc_`)
4. **Copy the Project Key**: This is different from your personal API key

## Updating the API Key

Replace the API key in `src/lib/posthog.ts`:

```typescript
posthog.init('YOUR_PROJECT_API_KEY_HERE', {
  // ... config options
})
```
